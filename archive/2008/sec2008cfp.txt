PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that
are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.
Papers should be at most 15 pages including the bibliography and well-marked appendices
(using 11-point font and reasonable margins on letter-size paper), and should be in
single-column format. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and so
the paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions are to be made to the
submission web site at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sec2008.
Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these guidelines
risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Papers must be received by the
deadline of January 17, 2008 (extended, firm).
Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the
conference. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in a conference proceedings.
The camera-ready version of the accepted papers must follow Springer guidelines for
the IFIP Series available at http://www.springer.com/series/6102 (see Manuscript
Preparation in LaTeX for contributed books under the link "Author Templates").
A Latex source file will be required.
