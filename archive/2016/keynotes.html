<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Daniel Le Métayer: The risk-based approach to privacy: prospects and challenges</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img src="images/Daniel_Le_Metayer.jpg" width="150" style="float: right; margin: 2px 0px 0px 15px;"/>
<a href="http://planete.inrialpes.fr/people/lemetayer/">Daniel Le Métayer</a> is Research Director at Inria and coordinator of the Inria Project Lab CAPPRIS 
(“Collaborative Action for the Protection of Privacy Rights in the Information Society”). The general 
goal of CAPPRIS is to foster the collaboration between research groups involved in privacy in France 
and the interaction between the computer science, law and social sciences communities in this area. 
Daniel Le Métayer previously was the head of the LICIT ("Legal Issues in Communication and Information 
Technologies") group within Inria. From 2000 to 2006, he worked for Trusted Logic, a leading company in 
security and open middleware for embedded systems. Daniel Le Métayer’s main research interest is the 
interplay between technology and law especially with respect to privacy protection (privacy risk analysis, 
privacy by design, accountability, etc.).

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Abstract.</strong>
Considering that data cannot be easily classified as personal or non-personal, or as sensitive or non-sensitive, 
it has been argued that is counterproductive to adopt a binary approach in privacy regulations because it can 
lead both to inadequate protection of data subjects in certain situations and inacceptable burden for industry 
for certain types of treatments. One possible way forward is to follow a more progressive, nuanced approach based 
on a rigorous analysis of the potential risks associated with data processing. Risk analysis is a common approach 
in computer security but it has received less attention so far in the context of privacy, which raises specific 
challenges. The keynote will address this issue and discuss the virtues and limitations of privacy risk analysis 
as well as further work needed in this area.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Herbert Bos: Crazy Time: Exploiting Software Without Bugs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img src="images/Herbert_Bos.jpg" width="100" style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;"/>
 <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~herbertb/">Herbert Bos</a> is a professor of Systems and Network Security at 
 Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He obtained his Ph.D. from Cambridge University Computer 
 Laboratory (UK). Coming from a systems background, he drifted into security a few years ago and never left. 
 He is very proud of his (former) students, three of whom have won the Roger Needham Ph.D. Award for best Ph.D. 
 thesis in systems in Europe. 
<br style="clear: both;" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract.</strong>
In this talk I will look at new types of vulnerabilties that may have disastrous consequences, but for which it 
is difficult to point at any particular bug in the software stack. In particular, I will discuss how Google allows 
attackers that compromise your PC to also own your phone (thereby killing SMS-based two-factor authentication), 
and a brand new attack on Windows-based systems that allows an attacker to completely pwn the latest Microsoft Edge 
browser with all defenses up, while not using a single software bug. The goal of this talk is to show that any sufficiently 
advanced attack is indistinguishable from magic.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bart Preneel: The Post-Snowden Threat Landscape</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img src="images/bartpreneel_small.jpg"  width="150" style="float: right; margin: 2px 0px 0px 15px;"/>
 <a href="http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~preneel/">Bart Preneel</a> is a full professor at the KU Leuven; 
 he heads the COSIC research group, that is a member of the iMinds Security Department. 
 The COSIC research group currently has 70 members, including 5 professors, 20 postdoctoral researchers, 
 and more than 40 PhD students. He was visiting professor at five universities in Europe and scientific 
 advisor at Philips Research. He has authored more than 400 scientific publications and is inventor of 5 patents. 
 He has graduated more than 50 PhD students. His main research interests are cryptography, information security and privacy. 
 Bart Preneel has participated to about 40 EU projects, for seven of these as coordinator. 
 He has coordinated the Network of Excellence ECRYPT 2004-2012 (250 researchers) and is coordinating ECRYPT-CSA and 
 the Marie-Curie ITN ECRYPT.NET. He has served as panel member, vice-chair and chair for the European Research Council and 
 has been vice-president and president of the IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research). 
 He is a member of the Permanent Stakeholders group of ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency), 
 of the Academia Europaea, and of the Belgian Privacy Commission (subcommittee national register). 
 He has been invited speaker at more than 120 conferences in 40 countries. In 2013 he testified in the European 
 Parliament for the LIBE Committee Inquiry on Electronic Mass Surveillance of EU Citizens. He received the 2014 
 RSA Award for Excellence in the Field of Mathematics and in 2015 he was nominated fellow of the IACR. 
 In 2016 he was invited to deliver the IACR Distinguished lecture.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract.</strong>
In June 2013 Edward Snowden leaked a large collection of documents that describe the capabilities and technologies 
of the NSA and its allies. Even to security experts the scale, nature and impact of some of the techniques revealed 
was surprising. In addition to “active defense” technologies and a focus on subverting end systems, the documents 
also reveal a systematic attempt to undermine cryptographic systems. A major consequence is the increased awareness 
of the public at large of the existence of highly intrusive mass surveillance techniques. There has also been some 
impact in the business world, including a growing interest in companies that (claim to) develop end-to-end secure 
solutions. There is no doubt that large nation states and organized crime have carefully studied the techniques and 
are exploring which ones they can use for their own benefit. But after more than two years, there is little progress 
in legal or governance measures to address some of the excesses by increasing accountability. Moreover, the security 
research community seems to have been slow to respond to the new threat landscape. In this talk we analyze these threats 
and speculate how they could be countered.
