Talk 1: ISMS in Action - an innovative approach
 
Speaker:
William List
CA FBCS CITP,
Partner, Wm. List & Co, UK

Abstract:
   Information security forms part of an organisation's total internal 
control system (ICS).  Using the ISMS described in BS7799-2:2002 as a 
base an ICS can be managed and include the wide variety of issues 
necessary to be covered in an ICS.
   If the risk treatment plans are created in the form of a story, 
telling how the management have implemented controls to limit unwanted 
impacts arising from events then it is much easier for everyone to 
understand why controls are in place.
   The effectiveness of the ICS can be determined by the management 
system's ability to ensure that incidents are detected in sufficient 
time to limit damage to the organisation.
   The use of HTML technology to record the ISMS and associated material 
makes it very much simpler for people to perform the necessary work of 
establishing and maintaining the ISMS as well as simplifying the task of 
certification auditors.

Talk 2: Practices and Experiments of Information Security Management

Speaker:
Koji Nakao
Director,
Information Security Technology Dept., IT Development Div.,
KDDI Corp., Japan

Abstract:
   In the early 1990's, although many cryptographic technologies had been 
developed, issues on security technologies were in chaos. We did not 
understand and clarify what was the risk, and how to link between 
security and business. BS 7799 has excellently provided 
an elegant solution to propose Information Security Management for 
Information Asset of organisations. For ten years, the so-called ISMS based 
on BS7799 has been widely popularized all over the world as a COMMON 
LANGUAGE for information security.
   For the purpose of information security, the organisation should 
properly establish and continuously maintain the information security 
management. In addition to this, training and education of Information 
Security Management are also getting important. Although the importance 
of information security management has been getting widely recognition in 
Japan, it is not the final goal just to obtain the ISMS certification.
   In my speech, after the introduction of the current activities of 
ISMS in Japan, I would like to focus on management know-how and 
technologies how to effectively develop and maintain ISMS. That is to 
say, key issues to be considered are to establish procedures and methods 
for the security controls based on the culture of an organisation and to 
pursue an effective bridge between management control processes and 
technical control processes.
